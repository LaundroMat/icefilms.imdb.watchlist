You need to have [http://superrepo.org/plugin.video.icefilms/](plugin.video.icefilms) installed before you can use this plugin.

Go to settings first and enter the RSS feed URL of your public IMDB watchlist. You can find the URL by going to [http://www.imdb.com](imdb.com) and clicking "watchlist" in the top menu (you need to be logged in). 
Slightly above the bottom of the screen you'll find an RSS icon next to a link "Export this list". Click the RSS icon, and copy that URL in the settins of this plugin.

This plugin has only been tested on Windows 7, XBMC Gotham 13.2 and plugin.video.icefilms 1.5.1.

Enjoy!
